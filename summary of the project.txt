## **Detailed Summary of What We Did (Git Workflow & CI/CD Setup for Blog Website)**

You went through a complete **Git workflow**, resolving conflicts, rebasing, and pushing changes to GitHub while setting up an **automated CI/CD pipeline** for a blog website hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Here's a detailed breakdown of everything step by step:

---

## **1. Initializing the Git Repository**  
At the beginning, you were working inside your project folder (`C:\DevopsProject`). You likely initialized a Git repository using:  

```bash
git init
```
This created a hidden `.git` folder inside your project directory, allowing Git to track changes.  

---

## **2. Adding a Remote Repository (GitHub)**  
You then connected your local repository to a remote GitHub repository:  

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/AayushG05/DevopsProj.git
```
Now, your local repository was linked to the GitHub repository.

---

## **3. Creating and Pushing the `main` Branch**  
You renamed your current branch to `main`:  

```bash
git branch -M main
```
Then, you tried to push it to GitHub:  

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
However, you encountered an **error**:

```
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/AayushG05/DevopsProj.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
```
This happened because your remote repository already had some commits that were not present in your local repository.

---

## **4. Pulling Remote Changes (Git Pull with Rebase)**  
To fix the issue, you fetched the latest changes from GitHub and rebased them with your local branch:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```
This brought in new changes, but it also caused **merge conflicts** in your files:  

- `index.html`
- `script.js`
- `style.css`

---

## **5. Resolving Merge Conflicts**  
When a merge conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting areas like this:

```html
<<<<<<< HEAD
(Your local changes)
=======
(Remote changes from GitHub)
>>>>>>> d081076 (Commit message from remote)
```

You had to manually **remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)** and **decide which version of the code to keep**. After making the necessary edits in all conflicting files, you staged them:  

```bash
git add index.html script.js style.css
```

---

## **6. Continuing the Rebase Process**  
After resolving the conflicts and staging the files, you continued the rebase:  

```bash
git rebase --continue
```
This successfully applied the local changes on top of the latest remote changes.

---

## **7. Committing the Changes**  
Once the rebase was complete, you ensured all changes were properly committed:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and updated files"
```

However, at one point, you got the **"nothing to commit, working tree clean"** message. This means that either:
- No new changes were detected, or
- You had already staged and committed all your changes.

---

## **8. Pushing Changes to GitHub**  
Now that everything was properly merged and committed, you **pushed** your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```
At first, you got another **push rejection error**:

```
! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
```
This was because more changes were added to the remote repository. So, you did another pull with rebase:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```
After successfully pulling the latest updates, you were finally able to push:

```bash
git push origin main
```
Now, your latest changes were **successfully uploaded to GitHub**.

---

## **9. Verifying Changes on GitHub**
You checked the updates by:
1. Visiting your **GitHub repository** at [https://github.com/AayushG05/DevopsProj](https://github.com/AayushG05/DevopsProj).
2. Looking at the **Commits tab** to see your latest commits.
3. Checking the **style.css, script.js, and index.html** files to ensure they were updated.

---

## **10. CI/CD Pipeline Setup for GitHub Pages**
Since this project is a **blog website**, you likely wanted to set up **GitHub Pages** for automated deployment. Steps you might have followed:

### **(A) Enable GitHub Pages**
1. **Go to your GitHub repository settings**.
2. **Scroll down to "GitHub Pages"**.
3. **Select the "Deploy from branch" option** and choose the `main` branch.
4. **Save the settings**—your site should be deployed at `https://AayushG05.github.io/DevopsProj/`.

### **(B) Automate Deployment using GitHub Actions**
To automate deployment, you could have added a **GitHub Actions workflow**:

1. Created a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
2. Added the following YAML script:

```yaml
name: Deploy Blog to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Deploy when changes are pushed to main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install  # If you use npm for dependencies

      - name: Build the site (if applicable)
        run: npm run build  # Adjust if you're using a static site generator

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: build  # Change this to the correct output folder
```

This workflow would **automatically deploy** the blog whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

---

## **11. Checking If Deployment Was Successful**
Once GitHub Actions ran successfully, your blog would be live at:  
👉 `https://AayushG05.github.io/DevopsProj/`  

You could check it by opening the URL in a browser.

---

## **Final Outcome**
🎯 **You successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline for your blog using GitHub Pages!**  
✅ **Resolved merge conflicts**  
✅ **Rebased & pushed code to GitHub**  
✅ **Set up automated deployment**  

Now, any time you make changes to your blog website (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`), you just need to:  

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated blog content"
git push origin main
```
And GitHub will **automatically deploy** your updated blog! 🚀🔥

----------- Commit message editor opened in the terminal --------------

---

### **1️⃣ `git rebase --continue`**
#### **What it does:**  
- It tells Git that you have **resolved all merge conflicts** and want to continue the rebase process.
- Git opens the **default commit message editor** (which is Vim in your case).
- You see a commit message that Git suggests for the rebased commit.

#### **What you saw:**  
- The commit message editor opened in the terminal.
- It displayed a message like:
  ```
  # Conflicts:
  #   index.html
  #   script.js
  #   style.css
  ```
  - This means those files **previously had merge conflicts**, but you resolved them.

#### **What you need to do:**  
- Save and exit Vim:
  - Press `ESC`
  - Type `:wq`
  - Press `Enter`

---

### **2️⃣ `git push origin main --force`**
#### **What it does:**  
- Since you used **rebase**, the commit history changed.
- This command **forces Git to overwrite the remote branch** with your updated local branch.

#### **Expected Output:**  
```
Enumerating objects: X, done.
Counting objects: 100% (X/X), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (X/X), done.
Writing objects: 100% (X/X), done.
Total X (delta Y), reused Z (delta W)
To https://github.com/AayushG05/DevopsProj.git
 + XXXXXX...XXXXXXX main -> main (forced update)
```
- This confirms that your branch was successfully pushed.

---

### **🚀 Final Result**
Now, your repository on GitHub is fully updated, with the conflicts resolved and all changes applied! 🎉
